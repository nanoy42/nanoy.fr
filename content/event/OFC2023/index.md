# summary: An example talk using Hugo Blox Builder's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: We report on the characterization of a SiGe PIC-based receiver along with its usage in a Gaussian-modulated coherent state CV-QKD setup. Excess noise measurements lead to secret key rate estimations of 280 kbit/s at 6.9 km.

      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''

        My research falls in the general scope of Quantum Technologies, and more precisely on Quantum Communication. Click on the items below to discover more !

        {{< spoiler text="Development of Quantum Communication Protocols" >}}
          In my current research, I am still working on experimentally developing quantum communication protocols, such as Discrete-Variable and Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution protocols or Quantum Random Number Generators. In particular, one of my goal is to increase their practicality and deployability. This research includes the development of open source software and transverse techniques.

        {{< spoiler text="Integration of components for Quantum Communication" >}}
          The field of photonics and photonic-based quantum communication may greatly benefit from the monolithic integration of components, as it did for the field of electronics and computing. This however requires the development of advanced components with high-performance in order to reach the specific requirements of quantum protocols. It also require the development of specific techniques, but they can also have advantages such as size and stability. I also believe that hybrid integration will be required to reach complete integrated systems.
        {{< /spoiler >}}

        {{< spoiler text="Quantum Communication Infrastructures" >}}
          While many quantum communication protocols have been demonstrated in laboratory contexts, but it also important to demonstrate those protocols on deployed networks and fibers. Such deployments also require additional transverse techniques for synchronisation and impairments correction. It is also an opportunity to investigate the practical security of Quantum Key Distribution and how it can be combined with other protocols such as Post-Quantum Encryption to improve this practical security.

        {{< spoiler text="Energetic Analysis of Quantum Communication Protocols" >}}
          With some of the earliest commercial devices arriving on the market, it is important to analyse their energetic cost before wider scale development. In addition, such a study could reveal another form of quantum advantage in the form of quantum protocols have fewer consumption than their classical counterpart. After an initial analysis of the cost of quantum key distribution protocols, I am now working on extending this analysis on the comparaison with classical protocols.
        {{< /spoiler >}}

        {{< spoiler text="Beyond Quantum Key Distribution" >}}
          Many techniques developed in the previous points can be used in protocols beyond Quantum Key Distribution. An example is the usage of balanced detectors, typically used in Continuous-Variable Quantum key Distribution, but that can also be used in hybrid protocols, entanglement based protocols or even quantum computation.

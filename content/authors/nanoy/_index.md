## About Me

I am a Ma√Ætre de Conf√©rences (Associate Professor) at Sorbonne Universit√©. My research is focused on experimental Quantum Technologies, in particular Quantum Communication. I graduated my PhD in Sorbonne Universit√© in Paris, working principally on Quantum Key Distribution and integration. I now continue on working on those subjects and more !
